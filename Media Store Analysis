On this project I used SQL to query data from a database called chinook, a digital media store, using SQLite studio. These are my answers to the following questions:

--#S1 What are the top 5 countries with the most customers, and how many customers do they have?

SELECT Country, COUNT(*) FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) desc
LIMIT 5;

--#S2 What are the names and contact information of the customers in the United States?

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Phone, Email, Fax FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'USA';

--#S3 Show Employees who are Sales Managers

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Manager';

--#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

--#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, 
--Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCOuntry FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices ON chinook.customers.CustomerId = chinook.invoices.CustomerId
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BIllingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;

--#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
--The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId 
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;

--#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT inv.Total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName AS RepFN, emp.LastName AS RepLN
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees AS emp ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId;

--#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

--#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

--#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT inv.InvoiceID, tra.Name
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS init ON inv.InvoiceId = init.InvoiceID
JOIN chinook.tracks AS tra ON init.TrackID = tra.TrackID
ORDER BY inv.InvoiceID asc;

--#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT inv.InvoiceID, tra.Name AS TrackName, art.Name AS ArtName
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS init ON inv.InvoiceId = init.InvoiceID
JOIN chinook.tracks AS tra ON init.TrackID = tra.TrackID
JOIN chinook.albums AS alb ON tra.AlbumID = alb.AlbumID
JOIN chinook.artists AS art ON alb.ArtistID = art.ArtistID
ORDER BY inv.InvoiceID asc;

--#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT tra.Name AS TrackName, alb.Title AS AlbumTitle, typ.Name AS MediaType, gen.Name AS Genre 
FROM chinook.tracks AS tra
JOIN chinook.albums AS alb ON tra.AlbumID = alb.AlbumID
JOIN chinook.genres AS gen ON tra.GenreID = gen.GenreID
JOIN chinook.media_types AS typ ON tra.MediaTypeId = typ.MediaTypeId;

--#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(init.UnitPrice * init.Quantity), 2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepID
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerID
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS init ON inv.InvoiceId = init.InvoiceID
GROUP BY cust.SupportRepID;

--#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(init.UnitPrice * init.Quantity), 2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepID
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerID
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS init ON inv.InvoiceId = init.InvoiceID
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY cust.SupportRepID
ORDER BY TotalSales desc
LIMIT 1;
